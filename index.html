                    <!-- <h2>The General Idea</h2> -->
                    <strong><p id="tagline">Dinosaurs like food. The tallest dinos get to eat the <em>best</em> food. Become the tallest dino to eat the ultimate snack!<br><br></p></strong>
                    <p>
                    The basic idea behind the game is that by eating more food, your character can become taller and taller. If you can eat more than your opponent, you get to eat the grand prize: A hand-crafted and made-with-love sandwich which only grows on the top of the tallest tree in forest. Whether you get to that point by skill in catching fallen fruit or by knocking your oponent over and stealing their food is up to you.

                            <p>Two players compete to eat as much food as possible. The actual controls (WASD or Arrow Keys) effect the body at the bottom of the neck. The neck flexes and moves like rubber, meaning that the head is more difficult to control. However, the head is the only section of the dino that can eat the falling food. Players have to manipulate the body to get the head into a position which they want. This should be a difficult task to pick up and easier as time goes on (think a logarithmic learning curve). For an equivalent, look to the game <strong><a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html" class="inline">QWOP</a></strong>.<br><br> Controls will be displayed during a short loading screen before the game actually starts. Because of the simple controls, this is all the teaching that will be needed for the play. <br><br>The game is broken up into three rounds with the final round being won by the player who heas eaten the most at the end of the third round. Based on who wins, an image or short animation will be placed on screen showing that dino as the winner eating the sandwich.</p>

                        <h3>Aesthetic Design</h3>
                        <div class="article_sbs_text">
                            <p>The game's art style will revolve around very cartoony graphics, probably vector-based. Sound is just some simple looping track that builds in intensity as the round gets closer to finishing. Character and food art in the game will be hard-edged, most other art assets will be soft-edged for quick and easy distinction between the two. <br><br>The UI will consist of a main menu page, a meter in the middle of the screen that points further to one side or another based on who's eaten the most food (think Guitar Hero versus modes). <br><br>Sound effects shouldn't detract from the focus of the game, so they'll be pretty quick and simple aside from some fun sound bytes for core game mechanics (eating piece of food will have the sfx of somebody absolutely demolishing a sandwich or apple or whatever the case may be). Backgrounds will have a subtle parralax effect to differentiate between further and closer elements.</p>
